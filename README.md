# term-cast

Once completed, term-cast is a cross-platform TUI Chromecast controller that can play files directly from a host computer. This project is directly inspired by Gnomecast and Videostream while aiming to provide a more lightweight, terminal-based, cross-platform alternative. 

## Acknowledgments

* This project would not be possible without [rust-cast](https://github.com/azasypkin/rust-cast).   
* File conversion is performed by the ubiquitous [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)  
* Finally, without inspiration from [Gnomecast](https://github.com/keredson/gnomecast) I would have never started this project.
